## üî≠ Overview

The increasing integration of intermittent energy sources (like wind and solar) poses a significant challenge to the stability of the electrical grid. This project, the **Hydropower Optimizer (HPO)**, provides a robust data-driven framework to mitigate this volatility. It uses a predictive model to forecast energy demand and an optimization model to calculate the ideal real-time dispatch from hydroelectric plants, effectively turning them into a flexible reserve to balance the grid.

-----

## üå™Ô∏è Core Problem

  * **Intermittency**: Wind and solar power generation can fluctuate dramatically, creating sudden "ramps" (surges or drops) in the energy supply.
  * **Grid Instability**: These ramps can destabilize the grid's **frequency** and **voltage**, risking power quality and security.
  * **Operational Constraints**: Hydroelectric plants must operate within strict **environmental and physical limits**, such as minimum water flow and maximum generation capacity.

-----

## ‚ú® The Solution: HPO

The HPO system is an integrated pipeline that transforms raw operational data into optimized, real-time dispatch commands.

1.  üß† **Prediction First**: It uses a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural network to accurately forecast the total grid load for the next hour based on historical data, weather patterns, and operational variables.
2.  ‚öôÔ∏è **Optimize Second**: It then feeds this prediction into a **Linear Programming (PuLP)** model. This model calculates the optimal amount of hydroelectric power to generate, minimizing any gap between supply and demand while respecting all operational constraints.

This turns hydroelectric power into a precise, data-driven tool for ensuring grid stability.

## üöÄ Project Pipeline

The project is structured as a series of Jupyter Notebooks that simulate a complete MLOps workflow:

1.  **ETL and Data Integration**: Extracts data from various sources (INMET, ONS, CCEE), cleans it, and merges it into a unified dataset. The pipeline is built to be resilient, using simulated data if an API fails.
2.  **Predictive Modeling (LSTM)**: A TensorFlow/Keras LSTM model is trained on the integrated data to predict `carga_mw_subsistema` (subsystem load).
3.  **Rigorous Validation**: The model's accuracy is validated, achieving a **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 9.33 MW**, which is a very low error margin for a national grid.
4.  **Advanced Optimization (PuLP)**: A formal optimization model calculates the ideal hourly dispatch, ensuring it meets the predicted demand while staying within the plant's minimum (`MIN_GERACAO_OBRIGATORIA`) and maximum (`MAX_GERACAO_CAPACIDADE`) generation limits.
5.  **MLOps and Deployment Simulation**: The final step simulates deploying the trained model and scaler. A function `predict_and_optimize_realtime` mimics a real-world API endpoint that would provide the optimized dispatch value to the power plant's operational system.

## üìà Key Results

  * **High-Accuracy Prediction**: The LSTM model achieved a low **RMSE of 9.33 MW** on the test set, demonstrating its reliability for operational planning.
  * **Optimal Dispatch**: The PuLP optimization model successfully identified the ideal hydroelectric generation required to meet demand, with a final error of **0.00 MW** in the simulation.
  * **End-to-End MLOps Workflow**: The project successfully simulates the entire lifecycle of a machine learning model, from data ingestion to a production-ready API concept.
